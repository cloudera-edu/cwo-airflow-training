"""Module 10 / Ex 11 - Asset-driven scheduling, producer (Workflow Orchestrator, Airflow 3.2.1).

Writes a CSV to the Anywhere Cloud Object Store and, on success, marks the
Asset (identified by its s3:// URI) as updated. consumer_dag.py runs as soon
as that happens.

Changes from the CDE / Airflow 2 version:
  - Dataset -> Asset (airflow.sdk)
  - HDFS and the `hdfs` CLI (not in the Workflow Orchestrator image) ->
    Object Store through the pre-installed Amazon provider
  - Your student name is part of the URI, so your producer only triggers
    your consumer on the shared instance

Needs the Airflow connection `object_store` (type Amazon Web Services) with
the Object Store access key / secret and Extra:
{"endpoint_url": "https://<object-store-endpoint>", "verify": false}
