"""Module 13 / Ex 14 - Deferrable operator + trigger, minimal (Workflow Orchestrator, Airflow 3.2.1).

Workflow Orchestrator runs a triggerer, so the task defers, frees its worker
slot, and resumes on its own - no manual kill or separate local cluster as
in the CDE version.

The operator is defined in this file (it runs on the worker, which loads the
DAG file). The trigger is the built-in TimeDeltaTrigger, which the triggerer
can import. A trigger class defined in a DAG file would NOT load in the
triggerer - see the README.
