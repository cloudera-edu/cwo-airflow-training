"""Module 24 - Partitioned assets (Workflow Orchestrator, Airflow 3.2.1).

The producer runs every 5 minutes on CronPartitionTimetable. Each scheduled
run gets a partition key (its time slot), and the asset event it emits
carries that key. The consumer runs once per partition and can see which
partition triggered it.

In production the producer would typically run hourly or daily ("0 * * * *");
every 5 minutes keeps the lab short.

The s3:// URI is only an identifier here; nothing is read or written.
