"""Module 19 - Time limits on runs and tasks (Workflow Orchestrator, Airflow 3.2.1).

Two DAGs, each with a limit that is deliberately too short:

  task_timeout_example_<student>  - execution_timeout on one task: Airflow stops
                                    the task after 1 minute and marks it failed.
  run_timeout_example_<student>   - dagrun_timeout on the whole run: Airflow marks
                                    the run failed after 2 minutes, even though a
                                    task is still working.

Deadline Alerts (the Airflow 3 replacement for SLAs) only *alert* and need a
notifier such as Slack or email; they are covered in the lecture.
